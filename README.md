## Question Answering Techniques and Paradigms  

Approaches of Question Classification:  

<b>Manual classification:</b>​ Manual classification applies hand-made rules to identify expected answer types. These rules may be accurate but they are time-consuming, tedious, and non-extensible in nature.  

Automatic classification:​ This type of definition helps on a better answer detection. Automatic classifications, in contrast, are extensible to new questions types with acceptable accuracy.  

## Type of Questions:  

Factoid: ​ Factoid questions are the ones that ask about a simple fact and can be answered in a few words.  

Complex questions:​ Complex Question is about information in a context. Usually, the answer is a merge of retrieved passages.
Examples to implement the above: Normalized Raw-Scoring, Logistic Regression, Round-Robin, Raw Scoring and 2-step RSV.  

List Questions: ​ Demands as an answer a set of entities that satisfies a given criteria.  
Example: When did Brazil win Soccer World Cups? illustrates this point clearly.  
 
Definition questions:​ They expect a summary or a short passage in return
How does the mitosis of a cell work?
